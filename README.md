Slides and code for O'Reilly Webinar on V-USB AVR Library

By popular (ok, one person asked) request: a video of the weatherThing in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYbuk5-bYo

You're probably mostly interested in the PDF version of the slides and the code directories, but I've left a bunch of the work up here for posterity.

You'll probably also need to edit the per-project Makefiles to match your programming environment.



Enjoy!
