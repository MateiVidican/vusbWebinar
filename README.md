Slides and code for O'Reilly Webinar on V-USB AVR Library

You're probably mostly interested in the PDF version of the slides and the code directories, but I've left a bunch of the work up here for posterity.

You'll probably also need to edit the per-project Makefiles to match your programming environment.

By popular (ok, one person asked) request: a video of the weatherThing in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYbuk5-bYo

Also, here's a link to my design for the V-USB spider that I showed in the video: http://littlehacks.org/propack/vusb_prototyper  Essentially, you plug this over the AVR chip in a breadboard, and it hooks up the crystal, zener diodes, and USB plug for you.  As extra convenience, I've included 4 user LEDs, a button, a reset, and UART serial in/out for debugging.  I know it makes my life easier...



Enjoy!
