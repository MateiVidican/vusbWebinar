+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
AVR Microcontrollers and the V-USB Library
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Motivation
++++++++++

Rolling Your Own
================

Why?
-------

* Parallel port is dead, serial port is emulated

* Compatibility

* Make what you want

* Fun


Why V-USB?
----------

* Software-emulated USB?  Limited to low-speed devices?

* Cheap, hackable, and you'll learn a lot

* Can run on very minimal hardware 




USB Background
++++++++++++++


USB is {\bf very} complicated.
=========================

Don't Panic!
------------

* Spec is 600+ pages long -- not including HID usage tables

* Hacker Approach: Just learn what we need to get job done.


Jargon
-----------------

* \emph{Human Interface Device} (HID): \\ Standard USB device classes that people interact with 

* \emph{Host}: Your computer

* \emph{Function}: The USB function on your device

* \emph{Endpoint}: A data source or sink (on your device)

* \emph{Control Endpoint}: Endpoint 0.  \\
  Must be present, two-way, used to control the device.



Wiring: The Physical Layer
==========================


* Pull apart a USB cable: 4 colorful wires


* White \& Green: \com{Data-} \& \com{Data+} \\ 
	differential signaling: opposite voltage levels signify data \\ 
	\com{D+} $>$ \com{D-} \leads 1 \\
	\com{D+} $<$ \com{D-} \leads 0 \\

* The data line signalling voltages are {\bf 3.6V} and 0V

* Data lines are also used to detect devices: \\
        \com{D-} pulled high = low-speed device \\ 
        \com{D+} pulled high = full-speed or high-speed USB \\

* Baud rate (low-speed) 1.50Mb/s $\pm 1.5\%$ \\
	NRZI, bit-stuffed (handled by V-USB library)

* Red \& Black: 5V power supply and ground ($V_{BUS}$)

* (@\_@) Consider labelled photo here?

Power
=====

Design Issue
------

* $V_{BUS}$ is a 5V power supply,\\ but we need to transmit using 3.6V signals

* Devices \emph{can} be self-powered: Run it on a 3.6V battery.  Done. 

* We all like bus-powered devices \\ \leads we'll have to work around the two voltages

* Two methods:\\  convert 5V down to 3.6V first, run AVR at 3.6V \\ run AVR at 5V but limit output signal voltage to 3.6V

* Good discussion of pros/cons at \com{http://vusb.wikidot.com/hardware}

USB is a Host-Controlled Bus
=================== 

What does this mean?
-------------------

* All transactions are initiated by the host: \\ 
	your device must wait to be asked  
	
* "You will speak only when spoken to"

* $IN$ and $OUT$ are defined from the perspective of the host: \\ 
  data going $IN$ is leaving your microcontroller

Enumeration: What happens when I plug my device in?
------------

* Host resets device then asks for device descriptor \\
  assigns the device an address \\ 
  then resets again and asks for a whole bunch of descriptors

* (Almost) All of this is handled by V-USB library




USB Data Flow Modes: The Ones We Will Use
===================

Four modes
------------

* One mode per endpoint: what does the device need? 

Control Transfers: configuration by host  
------------
*	$IN$/$OUT$ through Endpoint 0: mandatory
*	Also for custom control protocols (Weather Thing)

Interrupt Transfers: high-priority, scheduled transfers 
------------
*	Host periodically polls for data 
*	Device should have data ready when asked  
*	Intended for small/medium amounts of data (Mouse)

USB Data Flow Modes: The Ones We Won't Use
===================

Bulk Transfers: large scheduled transfers 
------------
*       Just like Interrupt, but with lower priority  
*	Meant for moving large amounts of data (Flash drive)

Isochronus Transfers: guaranteed bandwidth 
------------
*	But no error-checking 
* Meant for large amounts of non-critical data (Sound card)

USB Data Flow Modes: Summary
===================

Control Endpoint / Transfer Mode:  
----------------
  Use for device enumeration \\
  Use for custom control data

Interrupt IN Endpoint / Transfer Mode: 
----------------
  Use for keyboard/mouse/gamepad data


Intro to V-USB
++++++++++++++


How Does V-USB Help?
==================

What needed doing?
------------

* Read incoming serial data, NRZI unpack

* Parse it, respond to our device address

* NRZI pack, send out serial data when able

* All this with tight timing

* Bookkeeping: Respond to host's requests for descriptors

What Do We Need To Do?
=====================

Configure
---------

* Configure descriptors, endpoints, AVR pinouts, CPU speed \\
  \com{usbconfig.h}

Write Code
----------------

* Attach/reattach to fake the device resets

* Write functions to handle control data \\ 
  \com{usbFunctionSetup()}
 
* Get our interrupt data ready if we use it \\ 
  \com {usbInterruptIsReady()} and \com{usbSetInterrupt()}

* Update the V-USB system at least every 50 ms \\ \com{usbPoll()}





Getting Started / Getting Oriented
========================

* Download the zip file or clone the repo \com{https://github.com/obdev/v-usb.git}

* The subdirectory \com{usbdrv} contains files to link into your code:
	\com{usbdrv/usbdrv.o, usbdrv/usbdrvasm.o}

* \com{usbdrv/usbdrv.h} describes the API \\ (you should read this to see all the possibilities)

* Copy the file \com{usbconfig-prototype.h} to your code directory and edit it
  to fit your particular configuration

* The \com{examples/} directory is full of goodies.  \\ 
	My scrollwheel builds off of \com{hid-mouse} \\
	The weather gadget builds off of \com{custom-class} 

Circuit Concerns 
==============

Power
------------

* Choose to run AVR at 5V:  \\ 
   use zener diodes to limit output voltage


Timing
------

* Baud rate with 1\%ish precision: 1.50Mb/s 

* Easy way: Use an external crystal for the AVR's CPU clock \\
	12, 12.8, 15, 16, 16.5, 18 or 20 MHz

* Cheap, kludgy way: run CPU clock out of spec \\
       Calibrate the AVR's 8 MHz internal clock using USB \\

* Viable option with ATTiny 45, 85, 261 chips  \\
	have a high-speed (64MHz) internal oscillator \\

Project 1: Scrollwheel: An HID Demo
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

HID!
====

Welcome to Infinity
-----------------

* The variety of Human Interface Devices is mindblowing

* Don't believe me? 100 pages of "HID Usage Tables"

* "Usage" is USB for what the thing does

* Usages are stardard

Usage Pages
-----------

* So many usages, that they're grouped in pages 

* Generic Desktop Controls, Simulation Controls, VR Controls
 \\
 Medical Equipment, Telephony, Camera

HID!
====

Usages
------

* Mouse, Joystick, Keyboard, Gamepad

* Tank, Submarine, Spaceship, Magic Carpet Simulation \\
  (Turret Position, Wing Flaps, Chaff Release, Dive Break)
  
* Head Tracker, Body Suit (points and positions for all joints)

* Golf Club (Sand Wedge, Stick Face Angle, Follow Through)

* Media controls, application launchers, 3D digitizers


Report Descriptors
==================

Overview
---------

* Look up your device in the HID Usage Table, \\
  and read through the right usage page

* If your device has multiple usages, you can group them logically into 
  \emph{Collections}: \\ 
  a Graphic EQ is a collection of sliders \\ 
  our Mouse is a collection of X, Y, buttons, and scrollwheel

* You can collect things together by "Application", \\ "Logical" layout, or
 "Physical" proximity

* Define your data structures: \\
     Buttons are binary bits (on/off), \\ 
	Axes need a full byte (or more!) each \\ 
	Scrollwheel is probably a signed integer 

Report Descriptors
==================

... or Cheat
------------

* Find a device that's like yours and rip off it's descriptor

* Modify slightly to match your situation, and you're done

* Making a mouse?  You're not the first.  Do an Internet search.

* Using V-USB?  Tons of documented projects out there.  


Report Descriptors
==================

Resources
---------

* USB.org's HID Page: \com{http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/ } \\ 
	Download and read the "HID Usage Tables" \\ 
	Especially see the examples in the Appendix \\
	
* USB.org's HID Report Tool: \\ 
  \com{http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage\#HID Descriptor Tool }

* Good overview tutorial: \\

USB Voodoo
==========

Debugging, etc (Linux specific?)
--------------------------------

* \com{lsusb}: lists all attached USB devices \\
	mostly useful to get VID:PID pair

* \com{usbhid-dump} dumps HID descriptors or full data streams (!) \\ 
	\com{sudo usbhid-dump -m 046d:c049 -e stream} \\ watches my mouse \\

* \com{hidrd-convert} converts a binary HID descriptor to text \\ 
	result as code, spec, or XML

* Combine:\\  
 \textcolor{cyan}{\tt sudo usbhid-dump -m 046d:c049 | tail -n +8  \\ 
 | xxd -r -p | hidrd-convert -o code }

Project 2: Weather Thing: Custom USB Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Making a Custom Device
======================

Advantages
----------

* Don't have to write a HID Report Descriptor

* Can do non-standard things: \\ 
	Control servomotors, for instance

Disadvantages
----------

* Requires writing host-side code

* Have to define and handle the commands yourself

* Requires a bit of detailed know-how: Control Transfers



Control Transfers
==================

What you need to know
----------------------

* Three Packet Types: Setup, Data, Acknowledgement  

* Starts with Host sending a Setup packet: \\ 
  specifies type, direction, and amount of data that follows

* Optional Data packet(s) can go either way (IN or OUT): \\  
  Device or Host can send the data packets

* If Host sent data, V-USB handles the ACK automagically


Setup Packet
=============

The heart and soul of Control Transfers
---------------------------------------

* 8 Bytes

* \com{bmRequestType}: \\ 
	Includes transfer direction (IN/OUT), \\
	Control Type (Standard, Class, Vendor-specific) \\ 
	Recipient (Device, Interface, Endpoint, Other)

* \com{bRequest}: The request command itself -- one byte

* \com{wValue} and \com{wIndex}:\\ Two words (each 2 bytes) of request options 

* \com{wLength}: Length of the optional data stage (in bytes)


Setup In Detail
===============

\com{bmRequestType}
------------------------

* IN/OUT matters.  Remember relative to host. 

* For custom commands, select "Vendor-specific"

* When V-USB gets a custom Setup packet, it calls the function \com{usbFunctionSetup}.  


\com{bRequest}
--------------

* Can specify 256 commands for the Device

* Host and Device agree on what the commands are / do

* For OUT data, you can send four bytes of arguments \\ 
  without even using the data stage 
  (\com{wValue} and \com{wIndex}) 


Control Transfers
=================

Using the Data Stage
--------------------

* To get data from the AVR to the host (IN) \\ 
  you need to specify \com{wLength}

* If you need to send more than 4 bytes OUT, \\
  you need to specify \com{wLength}

* V-USB calls the functions 
  \com{usbFunctionRead()} and \com{usbFunctionWrite()} to handle these data
  transactions \\ 
  ("read" reads data into the host)

* Gotcha: need to enable read/write functions in the config

* See the example \com{hid-data} and \com{usbdrv.usbdrv.h} for details
   
Enough Talk, Let's Code
=======================

Host-Side: Python
=================

Setup
------

* Install Python and the \com{pyusb} library 

* Win/Mac will also need \com{libusb}

* See \com{https://github.com/walac/pyusb} for install help  
%  and \com{https://github.com/walac/pyusb/blob/master/docs/tutorial.rst} for an intro 

* Quick test: \\ 
:: \inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize]{python}{pyusb_test.py}

 Prints out VID:PID of all devices attached (in hexadecimal)


Host-Side: Python
=================

Code Outline:
-------------

* Fetch weather forecast data over Internet

* Convert to pulse length for servomotor

* Push pulse length over USB to AVR using Control Transfer

Control Transfer:
-----------------

* Need to build \com{bmRequestType}: \\ 
  OUT transfer, Vendor-specific

* Set \com{wValue} to the desired pulse length

* No data.  Done.


Host-Side: Python
=================

:: \inputminted[fontsize=\scriptsize]{python}{}








Crazy Tricks
============

A Potpourri of Hacks:
----------------------

* Use the control messages for custom communications even though you've defined an HID device \\ 
  lets you get around need to install drivers in Windows \\ 
  lets you design a smart/configurable keyboard

* Define your device descriptors in RAM, re-enumerate as different devices on the fly \\
  One device?  Or muliple?

* USB Jamming / Spoofing: Host-mode bus.  What happens if you disobey?

* USB Sniffing: What happens if your device doesn't disregard packages meant for others?

* Turn one device into another
