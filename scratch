* Limited in current: default is 100mA \\
  the device can ask for up to 500mA

* Suspend mode requires device to use very little current \\ 
	$500 \mu A$  (but practically you can ignore this)



Crazy Tricks
============

A Potpourri of Hacks:
----------------------

* Use the control messages for custom communications even though you've defined an HID device \\ 
  lets you get around need to install drivers in Windows \\ 
  lets you design a smart/configurable keyboard

* Define your device descriptors in RAM, re-enumerate as different devices on the fly \\
  One device?  Or muliple?

* USB Jamming / Spoofing: Host-mode bus.  What happens if you disobey?

* USB Sniffing: What happens if your device doesn't disregard packages meant for others?

* Turn one device into another



USB Voodoo (Aside)
==========

Debugging, etc 
--------------------------------

* \com{lsusb}: lists all attached USB devices \\
	mostly useful to get VID:PID pair

* \com{usbhid-dump} dumps HID descriptors or full data streams (!) \\ 
	\com{sudo usbhid-dump -m 046d:c049 -e stream} \\ watches my mouse \\

* \com{hidrd-convert} converts a binary HID descriptor to text \\ 
	result as code, spec, or XML

* Combine:\\  
 \com{sudo usbhid-dump -m 046d:c049 | tail -n +8  \\ 
 | xxd -r -p | hidrd-convert -o code }
